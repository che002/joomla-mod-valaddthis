= Introduction =

Here you are going to learn how you can have Joomla display a module in an article. The standard Joomla plugin called *_Content - Load Module_* has to be enabled (after a fresh Joomla installation it is enabled by default). Go to the Plugin Manager and double check if it is enabled. If it is not, then enable it.


= Details =

 * Go to the Module Manager, find the module and click on it to edit it.
 * On the Module's Edit screen and on the left hand side, click with the mouse in the "position" field.
 * You can now enter a user-defined position for the module. Name it with a unique name, so that it doesn't conflict with the other template positions.
 * Now in the article content add this text: *_{loadposition userposition}_*,where *_userposition_* is the name you entered before in the Module's Edit screen.
 * The Module will now appear in that specific place of the article, where you typed *_{loadposition userposition}_*.
 * In case you want to use multiple copies of a Module, bear in mind that you should configure them so they appear in different user-defined positions. That is, for every copy of a Module a new user-defined position.
